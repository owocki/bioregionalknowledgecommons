# Vocabulary mappings
# Each mapping includes:
#   - source_term: Term used in source node
#   - target_term: Equivalent term in target node
#   - confidence: 0.0-1.0 indicating translation reliability
#   - notes: Context or limitations

mappings:
  # Water rights and access
  - source_term: "water rights"
    target_term: "water allocation"
    confidence: 0.95
    notes: "Both refer to legal rights to use water, slight terminology difference"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "prior appropriation"
    target_term: "first in time, first in right"
    confidence: 0.99
    notes: "Same legal doctrine, different naming conventions"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "beneficial use"
    target_term: "reasonable use"
    confidence: 0.75
    notes: "Slightly different legal standards in Colorado vs California"
    bidirectional: true

  # Watershed features
  - source_term: "arroyo"
    target_term: "seasonal creek"
    confidence: 0.85
    notes: "Southwest term for ephemeral stream; Sierra uses 'seasonal creek'"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "acequia"
    target_term: "irrigation ditch"
    confidence: 0.70
    notes: "Acequia implies community governance; 'irrigation ditch' is more generic"
    bidirectional: false

  - source_term: "Rio Grande basin"
    target_term: null
    confidence: 0.0
    notes: "No equivalent - Rio Grande is specific to Colorado Plateau"
    bidirectional: false

  # Water management
  - source_term: "compact allocation"
    target_term: "interstate agreement"
    confidence: 0.90
    notes: "Both refer to multi-state water sharing arrangements"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "consumptive use"
    target_term: "water consumption"
    confidence: 0.98
    notes: "Technical vs common terminology"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "return flow"
    target_term: "return water"
    confidence: 0.95
    notes: "Water that returns to system after use"
    bidirectional: true

  # Ecology
  - source_term: "cryptobiotic crust"
    target_term: "biological soil crust"
    confidence: 0.92
    notes: "Desert ecosystem term; Sierra uses more generic term"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "pinyon-juniper woodland"
    target_term: "mixed conifer forest"
    confidence: 0.40
    notes: "Different ecosystems, partial overlap in transition zones"
    bidirectional: false

  # Conservation
  - source_term: "ephemeral flow protection"
    target_term: "intermittent stream protection"
    confidence: 0.88
    notes: "Both address seasonal water body conservation"
    bidirectional: true

  - source_term: "instream flow"
    target_term: "environmental flow"
    confidence: 0.93
    notes: "Water left in stream for ecological purposes"
    bidirectional: true
